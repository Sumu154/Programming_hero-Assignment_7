### Key Features
1. **Player Selection**: Users can choose players for their team, subject to coin limitations and other conditions like team size restrictions.
2. **Real-Time Coin Management**: Users can earn coins by interacting with the banner, which allows them to buy players for their team.
3. **Validation & Alerts**: Validation rules ensure that players can only be selected within the given constraints (coins and team size). Alerts are handled using React-Toastify for better user experience.
